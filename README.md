# YouTube Wall

On a recent trip to the YouTube offices I noticed their cool video wall playing popular YouTube videos in the lobby. We needed one of those in our office, but we didn't really think purchasing nine huge monitors as a cost effective solution at this time...but I figured I could make something pretty close using the YouTube API that would run on a single monitor.
